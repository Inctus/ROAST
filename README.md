# ROAST
Replicated Observable Asynchronous State Tree

--------

ROAST aims to centralise state management on Roblox.

It uses an Observable State Tree, which is a tree of state, paired with the observer pattern, to create a reactive approach to state management.

--------

ROAST development is closed source as of yet, but we may decide to update this repository when it is stable enough.
